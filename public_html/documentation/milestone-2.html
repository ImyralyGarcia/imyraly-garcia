<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
<div>
    <h3>Welcome:</h3>
    <p>There will be an introduction of my name and 3-4 keywords to describe who I am on the left side. The text will be
        overlaid on a large photo.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p>My about me will be a short and sweet overview of my background. While adding details about my passion for all
        things design and web development. I want to give glimpses into who I am outside of work, like a dog lover with
        two creative businesses. I'd like to add icons that pertain to my hobbies and likes.I want to set a fun and
        personable tone with this section because it fits my personality and overall environment I would love to work
        in. I will add another photo of myself to the right of the text.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Portfolio:</h3>
    <p>I would like for this to be more of a resume section where I include my education, certifications, and experience
        with content creation. As a new web developer, my experience is limited but I would like to add our capstone
        project with a photo and link inviting users to check it out! There will be sections for my work exerience,
        projects, etc. and anytime you hover over the text, a text bubble with more details will pop up and disappear
        when you move your mouse away. For the mobile site, you will have to click on an arrow to the right of the
        sections and the details for each section will appear.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Contact:</h3>
    <p>This section will have a contact form with a witty or sweet, "get in touch" with me message. The footer will
        include links to my github, linkedin, twitter, and instagram page, and possibly my professional address.</p>
