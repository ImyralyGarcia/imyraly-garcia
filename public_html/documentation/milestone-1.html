<h1>Imyraly Garcia Professional Portfolio Persona</h1>
<h2>Ella James</h2>
<h2>Profession</h2>
<p>Ella is starting her own wedding decor rental business. She graduated with her bachelor's degree in business in 2020.
    Her goal has always been to start her own business that centered around design and weddings. </p>
<h3>Technology:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>iPad Pro 12.9" with magic keyboard and Apple pencil 2nd generation</li>
    <li>iPhone 11 with 256GB</li>
    <li>Proficiency: Ella has a mid-level proficiency with technology. She knows her way around an iPhone and recently
        purchased an iPad with the magic keyboard to replace her laptop that she used throughout high school and
        college. She likes the apps and touchscreen ability that the iPad Pro offers. While taking online courses, Ella
        learned how to use specific apps to help her with organization and inventory. She is a power user.
    </li>
    <li>Ella doesn't hate technology but there are aspects of it that she does. There's a learning curve with everything
        and it can be frustrating when learning your way around a computer, phone, or application.

    <h3>Attitudes & Needs:</h3>
    <p>Ella James wants to hire a developer and website designer to begin marketing her wedding decor business. Her
        preference is to hire an individual who can both develop and design a perfectly curated website for her
        business. She wants it to be just as aesthetically pleasing as her instagram business page that she spent a long
        time and effort designing. Therefore, someone with a passion for design would be an ideal candidate. It's not
        necessary but she would like to work with someone who has a touch of wedding industry knowledge because they may
        better understand her needs and passion. My professional portfolio demonstrates my background in wedding design
        and marketing. It will display my work and certification as a fullstack developer. As well as demonstrating my
        love for all things design.</p>
    <h3>Frustrations</h3>
    <p>As recent college graduate and aspiring small business owner, Ella doesn't have a large budget for her website.
        She hasn't found a developer or website designer that will work within her budget. She attempted to create her
        own website on wix but it doesn't look anything like what she envisions. Her main frustration is that she posted
        a website launch reveal on her instagram page, 1 month from now and no one has that quick of a turnaround time.
        It has been a daunting task to find someone who can create her website, understands her design needs, all within
        a 1 month timeframe and within her budget.</p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>Ella wants to visit a professional portfolio website that demonstrates their work with visuals. Visuals catch her
        eye more than text. She wants to be able to see their prior work background and get a sense of the candidate's
        personality in hopes it will mesh well with hers. Being able to save a resume for her records is ideal so that
        she can look back at it when selecting the perfect candidate.</p>
    <h3>User Story</h3>
    As a power user, I want to hire a fullstack web developer to create my business website.

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This project will be a professional portfolio website with a focus on web design and digital marketing.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>This is a personal website designed with a professional audience in mind. While appealing to those who just
            want to build their network, bloggers, and even content creators. My target audience includes but not
            limited to: hiring managers, startup founders, businesses seeking freelance work, recruiters, professional
            peers, and bloggers. </p>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>My overarching goal for this site is to share my skill set and passion with the public while visually
            portraying who I am on a personal level. I want to come across in both a professional but fun-loving manner.
            The site will allow potential employers to know who I am professionally and personally. My secondary goal is
            for users to contact me with any collaborations they have in mind, whether that be in the tech, design, or
            blogging space.</p>
